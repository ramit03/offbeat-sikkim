        "Thank you for organising our trip. The homestays recommended by Offbeatsikkim provided a unique and immersive experience. We were welcomed into the homes of warm and friendly locals, who shared their traditions, stories, and even taught us how to prepare traditional meals. The cozy and well-maintained rooms offered a peaceful retreat after our daily adventures. Staying in these homestays allowed us to connect with the local culture in a meaningful way.",

        "Highly recommended to explore the real beauty of beautiful sikkim. From the booking to travel , the experience was very pleasant.  Before picking up offbeat sikkim for our travel, i got quotes from different leading travel companies, but offbeat sikkim stood best among them, because of their local presence and expertise. We stayed in five different homestays and used three drivers for our entire trip. The experience as a whole is amazing and memorable. Please do clearly mention your needs and expectations before the travel with the team. They will curate accordingly.",

        "I was part of the group that embarked on a journey from October 1 to 6, 2023. However, due to an unexpected flash flood on the night of October 3 courtesy of the Teesta river, our stay in Lachung was extended until October 11, 2023. Throughout this unplanned extension, the Offbeat Sikkim team proved to be our guardians. Before the flood disrupted our plans, they diligently guided us to all the destinations mentioned in our itinerary, ensuring our accommodations were both clean and secure. Even after the flood, they kept their promise by promptly assembling their team to oversee our safe evacuation. A special mention must go to our trip leader, Topden, who not only maintained a cheerful spirit but also shared fascinating facts about our destinations. We must also commend our skilled driver, Umesh, who navigated challenging terrains with the utmost safety and skill.",
